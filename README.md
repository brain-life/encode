# About
This software implements a framework to encode structural brain connectomes into multidimensional arrays. These arrays are commonly referred to as [tensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4462). Encoding Connectomes provides an agile framework for computing over connectome edges and nodes efficiently. We provide several examples of operations that can be performed using the framework.

One major application of the tensor encoding is the implementaion of the [Linear Fascicle Evaluation method](http://francopestilli.github.io/life/), in short [LiFE](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n10/abs/nmeth.3098.html). The tensor encoding method allows implementing LiFE with dramatic reduction in storage requirements, up to 40x compression factors. Furtheremore, connectome encoding allows performing multiple computational neuroanatomy operations such as tract-dissections, virtual lesions, and connectivity estimates very efficiently using the machine-friendly array operators. 

We provide demos to expain how to:
 (1) Load and encode diffusion-weighted data and tractography models of white matter fascicles, as well as perform multidimensional arrays operations. 
 (2) Build and optimize a Linear Fascicle Evaluation model. 
 (4) Perform neuronatomical segmentations, computational neuroanatomy operations and virtual lesions using the connectome encoding framework.
 (4) Reproduce some fo the figures of article describing the method implemented in thsi toolbox: Caiafa and Pestilli, forthcoming.

## Application.
* Encoding of brain conenctome and associated phenotypes into multidimensional arrays.
* Evaluate the evidence supporting white-matter connectomes generated using [magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI) and [computational tractography ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractography).
* Perform statistical inference on white-matter connectomes: Compare white-matter connectomes, show the evidence for white-matter tracts and connections between brain areas.

## Installation.
1. Download (https://github.com/brain-life/life).
2. [Start MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/startup-and-shutdown.html).
3. Add repository to the [matlab search path](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html).

## Dependencies.
* [MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).
* [vistasoft](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft).
* [Matlab Brain Anatomy (MBA)](https://github.com/francopestilli/mba).

## Getting started.
Learn about LiFE by using [file_name.m](github.io/file) in [MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/startup-and-shutdown.html).

### 1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/brain-life/life).
* Download the LiFE repository from the TAR/ZIP files linked [here](https://github.com/brain-life/life/archive/master.zip).
* UNZIP/UNTAR the file.
* Add the life folder to your matlab search path. To do so in the MatLab prompt type: 
```
   >> addpath(genpath('/my/path/to/the/life/folder/'))
```

### 2. [Download the vistasoft repository](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft).
* Download the VISTASOFT repository from the TAR/ZIP files linked [here](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft/archive/master.zip).
* UNZIP/UNTAR the file.
* Add the VISTASOFT folder to your matlab search path. To do so in the MatLab prompt type: 
```
   >> addpath(genpath('/my/path/to/the/VISTASOFT/folder/'))
```

### 3. [Download the Demo Data](http://PURL-to-DEMO-data).
* Download the LiFE demo data set from the repository [here](https://demo-data/demo_data.tar.gz).
* UNZIP/UNTAR the file.
* Add the unzipped/untarred Data folder to your matlab search path. To do so in the MatLab prompt type:
```
   >> addpath(genpath('/my/path/to/the/data_demo/folder/'))
```

### 4. [Read the demo_connectome_evalaution documentation](http://URL).
Read the description of the calculations in the documentation inside the file, demo_connectome_evaluation.m by typing the following in the matlab prompt: 
```
  >>  edit demo_connectome_evaluation.m
```

### 5. [Run the demo_connectome_evalaution code](URL).
This final step will run the life_demo code. The code will perform the operations described [here](http://URL). 
```
  >>  demo_connectome_evalaution.m
```
demo_connectome_evalaution.m runs in about 3 hours on a modern Intel processor with 8GB of RAM. This code has been tested with MatLab 2015b on Ubuntu 15+ and Mac OSX 10.11.
